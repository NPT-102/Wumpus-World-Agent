# Wumpus World Agent System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This is a complete anti-cheat implementation of the Wumpus World Agent system with 3 different agent types, all using a 4x4 map as requested.

## Agent Types Implemented

### 1. Random Agent (`agent/random_agent.py`)
- **Behavior**: Makes completely random decisions
- **Actions**: Random movement, turning, and shooting
- **Strategy**: No strategy, pure randomness with slight bias towards movement
- **Usage**: Baseline comparison agent

### 2. Hybrid Agent (`agent/hybrid_agent.py`)
- **Behavior**: 60% logical decisions, 40% random decisions
- **Logic**: Simple knowledge tracking of safe/dangerous positions
- **Features**: 
  - Basic loop detection and breaking
  - Safe position preference
  - Home navigation when has gold
  - Stench-based shooting decisions
- **Strategy**: Balanced approach between exploration and safety

### 3. Hybrid Dynamic Agent (`agent/hybrid_agent_action_dynamic.py`)
- **Behavior**: Like Hybrid Agent but with Wumpus movement every 5 actions
- **Special Feature**: Tracks action count and triggers Wumpus movement
- **Dynamic Behavior**: 
  - More cautious when Wumpus about to move
  - Knowledge updates after Wumpus movement
  - Prefers previously visited positions for safety
- **Strategy**: Adaptive to changing environment

### 4. Intelligent Agent (Bonus - `agent/intelligent_agent.py`)
- **Behavior**: Advanced risk calculation and probability-based decisions
- **Features**:
  - Bayesian inference for danger assessment
  - Sophisticated loop detection
  - Risk-based pathfinding
  - Strategic shooting decisions
- **Strategy**: Maximum survival with intelligent exploration

## Key Features

### Anti-Cheat Implementation
- **No Direct Map Access**: Agents can only perceive through environment interface
- **Clean Environment Interface**: `env_simulator/environment.py` provides only legitimate percepts
- **No Omniscient Knowledge**: Agents must build knowledge through exploration
- **Fair UI**: No information leakage in visualization

### 4x4 Map Constraint
- Fixed map size as requested
- Appropriate difficulty for testing all agent types
- Balanced challenge with Wumpuses, pits, and gold placement

### Dynamic Wumpus Movement
- Implemented in `env_simulator/environment.py`
- Wumpus moves every 5 actions in Hybrid Dynamic mode
- Updates stench patterns dynamically
- Maintains game balance

## Usage

### Command Line Testing
```bash
# Test specific agent type
python main.py random
python main.py hybrid  
python main.py dynamic
python main.py intelligent

# Test all agents for comparison
python main.py
```

### Graphical Interface
```bash
python wumpus_ui.py
```
- Select agent type from dropdown: Random, Hybrid, Hybrid Dynamic, Intelligent
- Map size fixed at 4x4 as requested
- Real-time visualization of agent behavior
- Play/Pause/Stop/Reset controls

## Technical Architecture

### Clean Separation
- **Environment Interface**: Prevents cheating through clean API
- **Agent Base Class**: Common functionality for all agent types
- **Wrapper Pattern**: Each agent type wraps base agent with specific behavior
- **Risk Calculator**: Shared probability assessment for intelligent decisions

### Anti-Cheat Measures
1. **Environment Abstraction**: Agents cannot access game map directly
2. **Perception-Only**: All information comes through `get_percept()` method
3. **No Auto-Updates**: Knowledge bases updated only through agent perception
4. **UI Information Control**: Display shows only what agent legitimately knows

## Performance Comparison
The system allows direct comparison of all agent types on the same map:
- Random: Unpredictable but sometimes lucky
- Hybrid: Balanced performance with basic strategy  
- Hybrid Dynamic: Adapted to moving threats
- Intelligent: Best survival rate with strategic thinking

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `agent/random_agent.py` - Random decision agent
- `agent/hybrid_agent.py` - Hybrid logic/random agent  
- `agent/hybrid_agent_action_dynamic.py` - Dynamic Wumpus variant
- `env_simulator/environment.py` - Clean environment interface
- `env_simulator/risk_calculator.py` - Probability-based risk assessment

### Updated Files
- `main.py` - Support all 3 agent types with comparison
- `wumpus_ui.py` - Agent type selection, 4x4 map constraint
- `agent/agent.py` - Anti-cheat base agent implementation
- Various other files for anti-cheat compliance

## Key Accomplishments
✅ Complete anti-cheat implementation
✅ Three distinct agent types as requested
✅ 4x4 map size constraint
✅ Dynamic Wumpus movement for Hybrid Dynamic agent
✅ Working graphical interface with agent selection
✅ Command-line testing and comparison
✅ Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
✅ Fair and challenging gameplay for all agent types

The system successfully eliminates all cheating behaviors while maintaining intelligent and engaging gameplay for all three required agent types.
